You can start El Capitan in recovery mode.  Then Tools->Terminal.

Then run:

$csrutil disable
$sudo chmod a+s /usr/sbin/pppd
$csrutil enable

This will allow you to set the permission that NetExtender needs.
Then boot as normal and everything should be fine.
The csrutil will ONLY work in recovery mode, so it has to be done in the manner I described above.

@maciej.nowak: please use the latest version of the VPN client found in the Mac App Store called “Sonicwall Mobile Defender.” Netextender has reached EOL. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sonicwall-mobile-connect/id822514576?mt=12
